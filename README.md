# Basic server telemetry with NodeJS and Socket.io
and I do mean basic. This is just playing with sending this type of stuff
over socket.io. Currently just sends current total memory available and
free memory available.

# TODO
Add graphs? Idk. I'd like to apply this to Dokku in some way, to get a dynamic list of all running apps, then have a dynamic page with a docker instance's stats, which I believe includes the nginx portion. Not sure. Needs more hacking
